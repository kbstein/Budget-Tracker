# Budget-Tracker

I built this simple budget tracking app for a school project. 
This app uses Google Firebase for user authentication, displaying ads with Admob and storing information with Realtime Database.

### Using the App

When first opening the app you will see a login/Sign Up screen (seen below). By creating an account it allows the user to login from multiple devices and
sync their budget tracking.

After logging in you will see how much money you have given the income and expense transactions that have been submitted (seen below). Below are three 
buttons that allow you to input income, input expense or view previous transactions.

The image below shows the screen where you can input the information for a new transaction.

The transactions button will take you to a screen similar to the one shown below. Here you can view and edit previous transactions. You can also delete
transactions by swiping to the left and tapping the trash icon that appears.
